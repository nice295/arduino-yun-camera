# Arduino Wireless Security Camera [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openhomeautomation/arduino-yun-camera.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/openhomeautomation/arduino-yun-camera)

This is the code for the "Wireless Security Camera with the Arduino Yun" project. This project is about connecting a USB camera to the Arduino Yun to automatically upload pictures to Dropbox once movement is detected.

## I updated this without SD card.
I try to use this project in just small memory.
